## Navigating the RStudio environment
RStudio has four panels. When RStudio is opened for the first time, only three are visible:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="When RStudio is first started, three panels are visible."}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/three-panel-RStudio.png")
```

The fourth panel appears after we open a new *script*. Do so by pressing on the icons highlighted below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Open a script by pressing the "New File" button, followed by "R Script".'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/open-script.png")
```

Now you should see four panels, as shown below:
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="After opening a new script, RStudio has four panels."}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/four-panel-RStudio.png")
```

What is the purpose of these panels?

* *Top left*: this area is for the ***script**. A script is
a text file in which we write R code. The script can be saved, 
such that we can return to coding and use our code at a later
date. Saving a script also allows us to share our analysis
with colleagues.  
* *Bottom left*: this is the **console** area. Here we can also
write code, however this is not saved when we close R. It is
therefore better practice to code from the script. Additionally,
RStudio returns output to us in the console. For example, a 
response to the command `4 + 4` will appear in the console.    
* *Top right*: this is the *environment* area. Here the names of
everything we import into or create in RStudio will appear. For 
example, when we import a spreadsheet into RStudio, it appears
in the environment.  
* *Bottom right*: this is a multifunctional area, including our
file directories and plots. 

## Setting up a project in RStudio
When working with RStudio, for example for an analysis or even
this workshop, it is good practice to have all relevant files in
one folder. This makes it easier to locate files and to share
our work with colleagues. This folder is called our
**working directory**. 

A convenient way to set and save a working directory is through
the RStudio *projects* functionality. Here we will set up an 
RStudio project for this workshop:

* Under the `File` menu in the top left of RStudio, press 
`New Project`, then `New Directory`, then `New Project`.
* Provide a `Directory name` - this will be the name of the 
newly created folder. For example, you could name it 
`msc-intro-R`. 
* Under `Create project as subdirectory of`, select a convenient 
location for this new folder. For example, this could be your
desktop or your `Documents` folder. 

RStudio should now have refreshed, showing us our project 
environment. Open a new script, as we did in the previous 
section, such that the four-panel view is restored. Then press on
the `Save` icon to the right of the `New File` button. Give the
file a convenient name, such as `msc-intro-R`. It will then 
appear in the bottom right of RStudio as `msc-intro-R.R`. 

## Saving data files in our working directory
As mentioned above, one of the features of the RStudio project
is that it allows us to have all relevant files in one folder.
We will download the data files for this workshop and save them
inside our project directory. 

*Complete once it's clear where and how the files are stored*.
