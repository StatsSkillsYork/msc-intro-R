## Navigating the RStudio environment
RStudio has four panels. When RStudio is opened for the first time, only three are visible:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="When RStudio is first started, three panels are visible."}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/three-panel-RStudio.png")
```

The fourth panel appears after we open a new *script*. Do so by pressing on the icons highlighted below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Open a script by pressing the "New File" button, followed by "R Script".'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/open-script.png")
```

Now you should see four panels, as shown below:
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="After opening a new script, RStudio has four panels."}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/four-panel-RStudio.png")
```
